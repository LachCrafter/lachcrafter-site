My projects, short stories on why I created them and maintain status are listed here.

## LachShield
*lightweight security extension plugin*

LachShield is one of my first project I have made, at that time I was just bored and I was learning to code.
It really helped me learning some basic concepts when I started it. And I can recommend to anyone that is learning to just make your own project and don't just follow some courses.
You can learn *solving your own (programming-)problems* and I was missing that when watching my 5th Java tutorial.

### Status
I'm still maintaining the project.
